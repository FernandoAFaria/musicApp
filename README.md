# Fernando's Music Project
## Directions
You will need to use the [iTunes JSON API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/) to grab the albums of an artist.

Then, display the albums on a React page. For each album you will need to display:
* Artist Name
* Album Name
* Year Released
* Album Art

 Feel free to be creative on how you display and style the albums. You may want to include any extra metadata that you find useful. 

 ##Technologies Used
 * React
 * Tailwind - I chose this only because I have been using this often at my current position on new projects
